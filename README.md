# Müvekkil

### Müvekkil is a start-up founded by 4 university students studying at Koç University, the most prestigious university at Turkey.

Müvekkil is a mobile application integrated with IOS and Android that aims to provide its users faster and cheaper legal consultancy than conventional law.

Müvekkil uses Artificial Intelligence based Natural Language models in order to provide its users the most accurate legal consultancy. So far, Müvekkil uses only a portion of Turkish legislation and law in force for its fine-tuning and embedding model. Müvekkil's ultimate goal is to use every single page of Turkish legislation to give its users most accurate guidance. 

This Flutter project is started on 10th of March 2023. 

The project includes a welcome page followed by sign up and login pages. After the user is authenticated, Müvekkil greets the user and writes "Hello, how can I help you today?". Based on the user's chat prompts, Müvekkil understands the issue specified by the user and displays the problem on top of the screen. Then, Müvekkil asks the user various questions in order to collect all the information needed before resulting in a conclusion regarding the problem. After the required information to analyze the case is collected from the user properly, Müvekkil provides guidance to the user, specifies the type of court in action, the courts the user can apply to, and the requirement of hiring a lawyer for the case.

In the project so far,

  Google Firebase database is integration is completed.
  Google Firebase Authentication is completed and Google sign-in plugin integration is on the way.
  Google Cloud solutions are used in order to make the required API calls to Müvekkil's AI model.
